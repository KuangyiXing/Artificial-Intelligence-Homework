    Description: This file defines a function which reads in
                 a DFA described in a file and builds an appropriate datastructure.
                 
                 There is also another function which takes this DFA and a word
                 and returns if the word is accepted by the DFA.
                 
                 It should be implemented for Exercise 3 of Assignment 0.
                 
                 See the assignment notes for a description of its contents.
